# For a given two-dimensional integer array/list of size (N x M), print it in a spiral form. That is, you need to print in the order followed for every iteration:
# a. First row(left to right)
# b. Last column(top to bottom)
# c. Last row(right to left)
# d. First column(bottom to top)
# Mind that every element will be printed only once.
